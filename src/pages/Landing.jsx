              Chris Lyons is a multi-genre musician and composer active in
              numerous genres and traditions and on several instruments.
              Although he is primarily a pianist, he also performs on guitar,
              violin, viola, bayan, oud and various unusual string instruments.
              He is considered to be an expert in such diverse fields as
              pastiche composition, classical improvisation and score-reading.
              He is also a highly sought-after tutor in jazz and classical piano
              performance with his former students including a number of
              internationally known musicians and even number-one-selling
              artists. He also runs all the balkan brass ensembles in Scotland
              and is a highly-skilled guitarist. He is a graduate of the Royal

              Attempting to summarise Chrisâ€™ activities in this field is fairly
              futile! He is a prolific polystylistic composer whose music,
              particularly nowadays always seeks to make a connection with
              audience and performer, such that they wish to return to it and
              develop a relationship with it. He very much believes in making
              music that will be performed repeatedly and that people can engage
              with. His music has been performed internationally and he is the
              recipient of a number of composition prizes. His music has also
              recently been in a BAFTA nominated film. He is contracted with
              Broadcast Music Incorporated
